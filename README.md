## 🧠 What I Did
- Cleaned and analyzed Syntegra Medicare CCLF claims data
- Compared **CVM (Cardiovascular/Metabolic)** vs **Non-CVM** utilization patterns  
- Segmented providers by claim types, costs, and patient visits
- Created Tableau dashboards for utilization and cost insights

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib  
- **Excel:** data preprocessing and summary tables  
- **Tableau:** interactive dashboards and story visualization

---

## 📈 Key Learnings
- Gained deep understanding of **healthcare claim structures** and **CVM disease grouping**
- Strengthened data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization skills
- Learned how to use multi-source data (Excel + Python + Tableau) for real-world healthcare analytics

---

## 🏁 Key Outcomes
- Found that CVM claims had **higher utilization** but **lower cost per patient**
- Improved data workflow efficiency through automated aggregation in Python
- Developed interactive Tableau dashboards showcasing claim-level insights
